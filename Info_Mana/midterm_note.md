## Information and Information Systems(IS)

### Today's business challenges

> - Intense competition and **environmental changes**

> - Increase of amount of knowledge that
affect your business -> **Knowledge Management**

> - Fast change of business environment:
**Time-based competition**


----------


### Historical Development of Information Systems

![image_1erlrnp3p1vnibca1metnfb1m79m.png-46.7kB](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image_1erlrnp3p1vnibca1metnfb1m79m.png)  


----------


### Management information system

Management Information System :
:    any system that provides information for the management activities carried out within an organization.

#### Why management information systems grow quickly?
>- Cost:  The marginal cost of using
it to generate information for many different purposes is now low.
>- Speed:  Cuts down the time that management is required to wait for reports once they have been requested.
>- Interaction: This allows end users to be selective about information extracted from the MIS.
>-Flexibility:  A modern MIS will have some in-built flexibility enabling the manager to decide what information is to be produced.

<br>

#### Design of the management information system

Special attributes of information that must be taken into account when designing an information system for management:

>- **Relevance**：The information that is generated by the MIS must be relevant to the
tasks for which it is provided.
>- **Accuracy**：Information should be as accurate as is required for the decision to be taken. 
>- **Timeliness**：: Information must be presented to the user within the time-span within which it is useful. 
>- **Target**： The information must be directed to the correct recipient
>- **Format**: The way in which the information is presented to the user will affect its effectiveness.
>- **Interactive nature**: Some information is best provided on an interactive basis.
>- **Control**: Some information may be sensitive or may be of value to competitors.

<br>

#### Approaches to management information system design

>- The **by-product** approach to the development of an MIS is perhaps the earliest used.
>- The **null** approach is a reaction against the shortcomings of the by-product approach.
>- The **key variable** approach assumes that certain attributes of an organization are crucial for assessing its performance, taking decisions and planning.
>- **Total study** processes concentrate on establishing a comparison between the information requirements of management and the information supply of the current management information system. 
>- The **critical success factor** (CSF) approach is based on the assumption that an organization has certain goals and that specific factors are crucial in achieving these goals.

### Use of Information Systems in Businesses

![image_1erlrq4vn19eh1gue191223qbck13.png-47.1kB](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image_1erlrq4vn19eh1gue191223qbck13.png)  

#### Information Characteristics at Each Level :

![image_1erlrsme91bqn1363h3k13nv116k1g.png-38.1kB](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image_1erlrsme91bqn1363h3k13nv116k1g.png)  

#### Scope of Processes :

![image_1erls5f2i1o9t1usln3bf9h1ijq1t.png-79.5kB](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image_1erls5f2i1o9t1usln3bf9h1ijq1t.png)  

![image_1ermbidvm1b0s408gm91spk4952q.png-59.7kB](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image_1ermbidvm1b0s408gm91spk4952q.png)  

**Examples:**
|Example|Decision type|
|:-|:-:|
|What new markets should we move into?|Strategic|
|How should we deal with a takeover bid?|Strategic|
|Should we expand abroad?|Strategic|
|Should we launch an advertising campaign?|Tactical|
|At what level should we set the budget for next year?|Tactical|
|Should we take a short-term loan to help our current cash flow position?|Tactical|
|Should we add more workers to a task to cope with an urgent order?|Operational|
|Does this customer qualify for a discount on a large order?|Operational|
|What to do with a faulty machine?|Operational|


----------

### The structure of decisions

**Structured decisions:**
:   are those governed by clear rules. The decision procedure can be expressed as a set of steps to be followed, can be incorporated in a decision table or revealed by a procedural logic flowchart. 

**Unstructured decisions:**
:   it is often unclear what information is needed and how it should be assessed in relation to the decision objectives. These objectives may themselves be unclear or the subject of disagreement. 

![image_1ermbogl81ge5uted411trko5m37.png-70.3kB](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image_1ermbogl81ge5uted411trko5m37.png)  


----------


### Computer program vs. information system

#### Difference between a computer program and an information system : 
>- A computer program runs some **instructions** to perform a specific task when executed by a **computer**.

>- An information system is used by **people** to perform certain **processes** by using **computer programs** to create, organize, use and distribute **information**.
>- An IS: a group of components that interact to produce information.


----------


### Components of an IS

> - Hardware
> - Software
> - Data
> - Processes
> - People

**Example of Bike Rental IS :**

![image_1erls99di8g01ihf2fq1n8bhf52a.png-184.7kB](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image_1erls99di8g01ihf2fq1n8bhf52a.png)  

|Components|Details|
|:-:|:-:|
|Hardware|Bikes (clean and dirty), servers, personal computers, hand terminals|
|Software|Bike rental management (customer query and update, bike search, bike return), billing|
|Data|Customer data, bike data, bike rental data, charge data|
|Processes|Bike rental (bike search and select, bike return), billing, bike maintenance, retrieve & update customer data|
|People|Customer, shop employees (rental and maintenance)|


----------

## Stragegic Planning and IS

### The need for strategic planning

>- Every organization has an overall direction
>- Day-to-day activities are performed to achieve the main purpose of the organization
>- There is a need for **continuous strategic
planning** due to
>1. Ever-changing internal and external factors necessitating resource allocations
>2. Need for subsystem coordination
>3. Expectations of different stakeholders (owners, customers, employees, …)


----------


### Business Strategy Determines Information Systems

![image-20210901122100617](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210901122100617.png)  

![image_1ermciiu8mmm169rm64b6e1b7g3k.png-57.4kB](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image_1ermciiu8mmm169rm64b6e1b7g3k.png)  

----------

### Strategic Relevance of IS

The **business information systems strategy** is focused on determining what information systems must be provided in order that the objectives of the business strategy can be realized. 

The **business information technology strategy** is focused on determining what technology and technological systems development are needed in order that the business information systems strategy can be realized.

<br>

#### Why Strategic development of IS?

>- Rapid diffusion of technological change makes it difficult to maintain a
competitive advantage
>- Hence, strategic development of IS is
1. a dynamic capability of an organization
2. not a static attribute

#### Advantages of Strategic System:
>- A strategic system alters the way an organization does business

>- Some systems offer a company a clear competitive advantage: higher profits or increased market share

>- Most systems enable a company to be an effective competitor

----------

### Characteristics of a Strategic Information System

#### Advantages of Strategic IS:
>- Significantly changes business performance
>- Contributes to attaining a strategic goal
>- Fundamentally changes
1. the way the company does business
2. the way it competes
3. the way it deals with its customers or suppliers

----------


## Developing an IS Strategy

### Five Forces Model

#### Define Five forces Model(Porter's Model)

>- Developed by Michael E. **Porter**

>- Describes **external influences** that affect an organization’s strategy and ability to compete

>- Objective: Use Five Forces Model to identify **potential areas** where IS can be used to gain a **competitive advantage**

#### Five Forces

1. New Market Entrants
>- IT may reduce labor costs and increase productivity
 -> without a similar investment a competitor will have disadvantages
>- Erect barriers to entry
 - exploiting economies of scale in production;
 - creating brand loyalty;
 - creating legal barriers to entry – for example patents;
 - using effective production methods involving large capital outlays.


2. Competitior
> **Industry Rivalry**
>- Novel IS may change the basis of competition or help to offer product / service with new
features
- Example: delivery service
allows customer to track
progress of package
-> competition is no
longer just based on
price

3. Suppliers
>**Bargaining power of suppliers**
>- Develop Alternatives
>- Use IS to maintain information on available alternative sources of supply
>- Create links with suppliers (via **Electronic Data Interchange – EDI**)
- Reduced delivery times
- Reduced paperwork and associated labour costs
- Increased accuracy of information

4. Substitute Products
> Pressure from Substitute products
>- Try to prevent substitution:
- Create switching costs
- Deliver products with better value
>- Example: "smart" manufacturing system of BMW can build customized cars on the normal assembly line

5. Customers
> **Bargaining power of customers**
>- Increased considerably in last years
>- Cost of switching to competitor deters customers from switching
>- Collecting data about customers helps to understand their preferences better

<br>

#### How to deal with competitive forces

Four **generic strategies** for dealing with **competitive forces**, enabled by using IS:
>- Low-cost leadership
>- Product differentiation
>- Focus on market niche
>- Strengthen customer and supplier intimacy

----------

### Internal stages of growth

The development of information systems in an organization as proceeding through several stages of growth.

#### The Nolan stage model

>The six-stage growth model (Nolan, 1979) was used to identify which **stage of growth** characterized an organization’s information systems maturity.
- Stage 1 Initiation
- Stage 2 Contagion
-  Stage 3 Control
-  Stage 4 Integration
-  Stage 5 Data administration
-   Stage 6 Maturity

>**Within each stage of growth**, four major growth processes must be planned, managed and coordinated:
1. **Applications portfolio**: The set of applications that the information systems must support;
2. **DP organization**: The orientation of the data processing
3.  **DP planning and control**: for example degree of control, formalization of planningprocess, management of projects, extent of strategic planning.
4.  **User awareness**: The extent to which users are aware of and involved with the technology.

![image_1ermd64poscjd4soi61cnq197341.png-35.8kB](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image_1ermd64poscjd4soi61cnq197341.png)  
On the Nolan analysis, most organizations will be at Stage 4 or Stage 5.

**Critiques:**
>- the growth of desktop computers has significantly increased the extent to which users have been able to use information technology and to become autonomous of the computer centre;
- there have been important developments in the area of communications and networks, especially local area networks linking desktop computers and other technologies together; 
- new software development tools and decision support tools have shifted the emphasis to the user as development agent.

**What Nolan's model can do by recognizing:**

>- that growth of information systems in an organization must be accompanied by an organizational learning process;
>- that there is an important interplay between the stimulation of growth involving the presence of slack resources together with the need for control;
>- that there is a shift of emphasis between the users and the computer centre in the process of growth; 
>- that there is a move from concentration on processor technology to data management.


----------

#### The Earl model

> For Earl, it is ofparticular importance to note that stages of growth apply to different technologies. 
**The S-curve represents cycles of new technological developments** where there is a **sudden increase** in understanding leading to **a new plateau**; 
this process of further developments and improvements and a higher plateau is a perpetual feature.

## e-Business and e-Commerce

### E-Business
>**Using web technology to**

>- Improve business processes
>- Enhance communication with partners, suppliers, vendors and customers
>- Perform business transactions securely

> **Potential areas in the business:**

>- **Production processes**: procurement, ordering stock, payment, supplier communication, production control
>- **Customer-focused processes**: marketing, selling, customer
support, order and payment processing
>- **Internal management processes**: training, recruitment, employee services

----------

### The development of websites

 **advantages to an organization in developing a website**:
>- Reduction in cost of advertising
>- Cheaper and easier provision of information
>- Ease of update
>- Lack of need to maintain a shop front
>- The ease of crossing geographical boundaries
>- The absence of the middleman

----------

### E-Commerce

#### Definition of E-Commerce

>“any exchange of information or business transaction that is facilitated by the use of information and communication technologies”

**`web` is not necessary in e-commerce**

- E-Commerce goes beyond home computer users
- Most parties involved are companies and public authorities
- The variety of systems is huge

<br>

**Whiteley** (2000) classifies e-commerce systems as falling into one of three categories:
>-  Electronic markets
>- Electronic data interchange
>-  Internet commerce

<br>

#### Types of e-commerce activities

|Transaction Type|Example|
|:-:|:-|
|B2B|Transactions between businesses|
|B2C|Companies selling products to customers|
|B2G|Transactions between businesses and public sector organizations|
|C2C|Transactions between private individuals|

<br>

#### E-Commerce Systems

 Business models take on many forms：
>- straightforward industry classifications, such as heavy industry, service sector;
>- methods of trading, such as shop, supermarket, auction;
>- structural definitions, such as functional responsibilities, ‘everyone does everything’.

Business models for electronic commerce:

>- E-shops and e-malls
>- E-procurement
>- E-auctions
>- Content providers
>- Market segmenters, infrastructure providers
>- Specialist service providers


<br>

#### Drivers for Using the Internet for Business

>- Cost
>- Flexibility
>- Protecting investment
>- Connectivity
>- Low risk
>- Improved customer service
>- Globalization

<br>

####  E-commerce allows businesses to gain competitive advantage

>- **Price competitiveness** : Reduced transaction costs in automated ordering and invoicing systems can lead to lower prices.
>- **Timeliness**:Faster ordering, delivery and invoicing can reduce the time to market for suppliers.
>- **Knowledge of market**: Trading electronically provides additional methods for companies to acquire knowledge of the market in which they operate.

<br>

#### Barriers to entry

>- Uncertainty over business models
>- Telecommunications costs
>- Bandwidth
>- Security
>- Lack of clear standards
>- Law and legal frameworks
>- Preparedness


----------

#### Porter's five forces model and e-commerce
>- Threat of new entrants: 传统行业的新商业模式（如书店、银行）
>- Threat of substitution：替代传统销售途径和载体（如音乐、软件、书）
>- Bargaining power of buyers：中间商地位下降（如航空售票）
>- Bargaining power of suppliers ：可能成为供应商的必要条件
>- Competition with rivals ：减少交易成本，提升信誉，增强与对手的区别性

----------

#### Conducting business over the Internet

The features that make a product more likely to be able to be sold over the Internet are:
>- browsing over a range of products where touch prior to purchase is not needed;
>- no advice is needed from the seller;
>- the desired choice is known unambiguously by a title or specification;
>- the range of products is large (and difficult to accommodate under one shop front);
>- the products can be despatched easily (ideally non-bulky, high-price products);
>- there would not be differences in the quality of the product between one seller and another.


----------

## The Cloud

### What is Cloud Computing?

>- Services and Solutions that are delivered or consumed in **real time** over the Internet
>- Cloud computing is a **delivery model of computing services** over the Internet

 * Optimization modelling (involves mathematical computation of optimization or goal seeking based on constraints)

#### Expert Systems

>- A computer system that emulates the decisionmaking ability of a human expert
>- A big hype in the 1980s, almost vanished during the 1990s
>- Revival nowadays through Robotic Process Automation:
 - A software application that replicates the actions of a human being interacting with the user interface of a computer system

#### Expert system shell

> Expert systems from which all domain-specific knowledge has been removed.

>- Allow speedy prototyping of expert systems- often by end users 
- Limitation: Not very flexible

#### Expert system tools

> Used to incease flexibility

>- control over ways of representing knowledge;
- control over the reasoning strategies adopted by the expert system;

# Information Systems Development

## Make or Buy - Reasons for System Development

### What is IS Development?

> Refers to the process of planning, creating,
testing, and deploying an information system

![image-20210901122157334](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image-20210901122157334.png)

### Information systems steering committees

>The purposes of the committee may lie within the following areas:

>- To recommend an overall policy for information and data-processing systems development
- To ensure that individual user department needs are being satisfied
- To initiate and monitor individual projects
- To coordinate individual projects
- To report ‘upwards’ to top management
- To be responsible for the appointment of senior personnel in the computer centre

### Reasons for (IS) Project Initiation

>- Current system cannot cope
>- Cost savings
>- Provision of better internal information for decision making
>- Provision of better customer service
>- Opportunities provided by new technology
>- High-technology image
>- Change in legislation
>- Balancing the portfolio of projects

### The participants in analysis and design

1.  users of the existing system
2.  Systems developers or programmers
3.  Systems analyst or business analyst
4.  
![image_1ermfdabvf22d633iu1rn76t34r.png-57kB](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image_1ermfdabvf22d633iu1rn76t34r.png)  

<br>

####  analyst's task

>- responsible for investigating and analysing the existing system as to its information use and requirements
-  judges whether it is feasible to develop a computer system for the area
-  designs the new system, specifying programs, hardware, data, structures and control and other procedures
-  will be responsible for testing and overseeing the installation of the new system, generating documentation governing its functioning and evaluating its performance

----------

### Make or Buy?

**Build Software**
>- Customized
>- Developed in-house
>- Developed by outside vendor
>- Full control can be beneficial if software is strategically important

**Buy Software**
>- Prepackaged software
>- Select software vendor
>- Customization may be offered by software vendor for a price

#### Problems of Making

Example of failure in making
> Digitization of the judiciary has failed and has to be done all over again

>- too complex
>- the work processes were not harmonized at the start of the program
>- the costs were estimated at around 7 million euros, while 220 million euros have already been spent.

- Customers might not clearly describe their needs or they don't know exactly what the needs are.  

<br>

#### Problems of Buying

>- risk of failure
- loss of money

----------


#### Costs to consider when making

>- Initial cost of building a system
>- Cost of enhancing the system with new features
>- Cost of repairing defects and bugs
>- Cost of customer support
>- Cost of refactoring
>- Removal of error-prone modules

#### Costs to consider when buying

>- Cost to purchase software
>- Cost to customize software
>- Licenses for named or concurrent users
>- Cost of infrastructure that software will run on: servers, network connections, network upgrades to support
higher loads or number of transactions
>- Staffing: training, maintenance, support, administration, incidental personnel

----------

#### When does “Making” make sense?

>- Making software may be associated with risks
>- Carefully considering potential costs is essential
>- Strategic software is custom software
>- In-house development is even more critical if you wish to retain your firm’s advantage

----------


## Systems Development

### Model of the Process of Analysis and Design

![image_1erm9gib52ifie11g1hle6cvkp.png-164.8kB](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image_1erm9gib52ifie11g1hle6cvkp.png)  

----------

### Stages in the life cycle of a systems development project

![image_1erm9i0oqchu13jvj411hb1bsf16.png-186.4kB](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image_1erm9i0oqchu13jvj411hb1bsf16.png)  

- one stage must be complete to get into the next stage 
- governments and large firms may prefer to use this approach

<br>

####Benefit of this staged approach (waterfall model)

>- Subdivision of a complex, lengthy project into discrete chunks of time makes the project more manageable and thereby promotes better project control.
>- Although different parts of a project may develop independently during a stage, the parts of the project are forced to reach the same point of development at the end of the stage. This promotes coordination between the various components of large projects.
>-  The deliverables, being documentation, provide a historical trace of the development of the project. At the end of each stage, the output documentation provides an initial input into the subsequent stage.
>- The document deliverables are designed to be communication tools between analysts, programmers, users and management. This promotes easy assessment of the nature of the work completed during the stage.
>- The stages are designed to be ‘natural’ division points in the development of the project.
>- The stages allow a creeping commitment to expenditure during the project. There is no need to spend large sums of money until the previous stages have been completed satisfactorily

----------


### Alternatives

#### Scrum

>- can be applied to any project or product development effort
- Product owner creates product **backlog**(a prioritized wish list)
- during SPRINT planning, team pulls a chunk from the top of that list and decides how to complete it
- the team has a set of time-frames the sprint to complete their work
- the team meet in a daily scrum to keep the work moving forward along the way
- the scrum master keeps the team focused 
- at the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable (normally sprint last for 2-3 weeks)
- the team conducts a sprint review on the product and a retrospective on the process
- then they choose the next chunk of the backlog and the cycle repeats

![image_1erqj9qf63bp4f31h9v1vvsonpd5.png-300.9kB](http://yunabell-image-repository.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/img/image_1erqj9qf63bp4f31h9v1vvsonpd5.png)  

----------


## System Analysis : Understanding the As-is Situation

### System Analysis basics

- is the 3rd stage of waterfall model (system development project model)
- The goal of system analysis `is to build a logical model of the system`

What must be done in order to satisfy the objectives and functions of the system under investigation?

Two main parts of analysis:

>**Data analysis:** 

> - Which data has to be stored

>**Process analysis:** 

> - Aims at showing the activity flow of the system, e.g. interactions with the system

### Participants in Analysis and Design

>**Business Side:**

>- User/ Domain/ Expert/ Client

>**Mediator:**

>- Business Analyst (key role, translate requirements)

> **IT Side:**

>- Developer/ Programmer

### Challenges of system analysis

>- Fragmented Process Knowledge
>- Domain Experts think on Instance Level
>- Knowledge about Process Modelling is rare

----------

### Process Discovery Techniques

>- Workshop-based
>- Interview-based
>- Evidence-based
 - Document analysis
 - Observation
 - Process mining

<br>

#### Workshop

>- Gather all key stakeholders together
>- One process analyst, multiple domain experts
>- Participants interact to create shared understanding
>- Often: software-supported, a model is directly created during the workshop
>- Model is reference point for discussions
>- Alternative: brown-paper workshops
